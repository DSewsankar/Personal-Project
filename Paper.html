line-height:200%'>Forgotten Away</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There are many
moments in my life that I would like to wipe from my memory and just forget
them completely because of the pain I have caused, or I’ve endured. However,
forgetting them would mean losing a part of myself. The shame, regret, and pain
that resulted from these moments shaped who I am. When the topic of memory
erasure came up, I thought about this issue and went through several variations
of my argument against it. They ended with me saying to myself “if this happens
there are so many unspeakable consequences to it that we can’t reverse”. <a>This
made me realize that I will inevitably always be against memory erasure. Memory
erasure has the ability to help people in theory. However, it may not heal or
cure the people it wants to help and may cause more significant harm than good
if implemented on our society. This paper will examine several arguments
against memory erasure and examine the validity of it being used to heal.</a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            The power to cause harm
in this world depends on the way that memory erasure is used. Currently, the
progress of memory erasure doesn’t completely remove the memory but instead removes
the emotions from the memory in the case of propranolol (Henig, 2004) Imagine a
science fiction reality where you can go into people’s brains and look through
their memory like a movie with the ability to pause and delete specific memories
at will. Let’s say you are an evil dictator abusing this power within this
reality. You have concentration camps set up in your country and they’re
exactly the same ones Hitler used when he was in power in Germany. The goal of
these camps is to extinguish and kill a specific group of people that you designated
as the problem for everything wrong in your country. Using this technology, you
wipe the memories of visitors that leave the camps. If anyone works at the camps,
they’re only allowed to work under one of two conditions. They either have to
live there or agree to have their memories of the camp wiped every night when
they go home in order to maintain the secrecy of what goes on there. The people
who are in charge of the memory wiping are loyalists who go through extreme
vetting by the government and have every place they attend bugged in case they
discuss what they see in the camp workers memory. They are also not allowed to
visit the camp or see it. These parameters are set in place to keep the
genocide and possible extinction of a group of people top secret. Anyone who is
found to have violated any of the parameters will immediately be put to death.
In this situation, the tyranny of a government and the crimes committed by it
could remain secret forever if no one is ever able to leak what is happening
there. However, this scenario in itself is extreme and if this happened it
would hopefully be done by only one nation. Although the chances are low, the
consequences of this being carried out are too great. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            <a>The next example of
future uses for memory erasure I would like to examine is the potential of it
becoming commercial. Let’s examine the realistic option that was tested on lab
mice. This involved the use of laser lights to block or deactivate the fear
memory in the brains of mice. If memory erasure were to become commercialized
with this technique, it would involve human beings going to the memory erasing
clinic to have specific memories blocked out in their brains. It would be
marketed on tv in ads during football games and primetime television.</a><span
class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'><a
class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_2"
onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_2','_com_2')"
onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_2')" href="#_msocom_2" language=JavaScript
name="_msoanchor_2">[AG2]</a>&nbsp;</span></span> The target audience would
include people who are having restless nights because of an accident or
traumatic event they experienced. They could get it approved by doctors at the
clinic and it’s uses would range from a bad breakup to severe post-traumatic
stress disorder. It would then become most commonly used for treating superficial
memory related problems such as having a guilty conscious, breaking off
relationships, and getting rid of mistakes made. The problem with memory
erasure being used for this purpose is that these events serve as markers for
growth and learning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When going through
a bad break up it serves as a place bad break ups typically are a result of it
being sudden and one person being caught off guard by how sudden the breakup
is. Another reason for a bad break up can be an abusive relationship ending,
the dynamic in those relationships is stronger than in a regular happy
relationship. The breakup serves as growth for the individual because they have
the ability to reflect on their relationship and see what went wrong, what
worked, what didn’t, and how to love. If they wipe the memory of the
relationship, then they lose all of those lessons and will enter their next
relationship repeating the same mistakes of the past because their memory was
wiped. Also, in the example of an abusive relationship, abusive relationship
happens when one person has power and control over another person. If a victim leaves
an abusive relationship then has their memory of said relationship erased, what
is to stop the abuser from coming back in that person’s life and repeating the
damage that they caused once again or in another scenario the abuser takes
victim to a clinic and forces them to remove memories of their family in order
to further isolate their victim. How will the victim in that situation come
back from that, they will be a shell of a person with no support system and has
to rely on their abuser solely because the memories of their support system was
erased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Wiping your memory
because of the experiencing of a guilty conscious is a problem because guilt is
the pain of someone who violates their own moral standards. If you wipe your
memory, then you wipe the understanding of the moral standard you violated for
yourself. This feeling is to help you understand what you shouldn’t do and
encourages you to reflect on what you did. It encourages you to make amends to
heal the wounds that were caused by your actions. If you wipe your memory of
the pain, you caused then you absolve yourself of the lesson you could’ve
learn. Guilt is the feeling that makes us connect with other human beings and
have emotions for them because of our actions towards them. If people routinely
wipe the memory of the pain, they caused then they will continue inflicting
that pain onto everyone with no explanation as to why. <a>Guilt was examined in
the 6<sup>th</sup> season of the show BoJack Horseman where the main
protagonist BoJack Horseman goes to rehab and finally sobers up. After sobering
up BoJack reflects that his dive into alcohol and drugs was to escape the pain
of guilt, they felt due to their actions. At the end of the 6<sup>th</sup>
episode in that season the main character has a back and forth with someone
they inadvertently harmed because of the consequences of their actions the
dialogue goes like this “I want you to remember this, BoJack. I want you to
remember what you did to me.” With BoJack responding “I remember everything,
I’m sober now” this sequence is important because for the past 5 seasons BoJack
never acknowledged the harm he caused in a serious, sober way. In that
statement he clarifies for the viewer the running away from the damage he’s
caused has stopped. After this point BoJack begins the road to making amends
for his past actions. </a><span class=MsoCommentReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:200%'><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_3"
onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_3','_com_3')"
onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_3')" href="#_msocom_3" language=JavaScript
name="_msoanchor_3">[AG3]</a>&nbsp;</span></span>If memory erasure is used for
the wiping away of guilt then people it too will just become an escape from
reality in the way that drugs and alcohol were used by BoJack (Netflix, 2019).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>With this
commercial memory erasure, we start to see a trend with the rich and wealthy
where they start going to the clinic on a regular basis to block out what
happened to them that day. They block out car accidents, harming people, stints
with rehab and addiction. This newfound behavior can lead to dangerous
qualities for us as a society because the actions of people add to our society.
When someone harms another individual there are consequences and those
consequences spread out into the other parts of people’s lives. Another example
from BoJack Horsemen about the way our actions have an impact on the larger
part of society is examined in the final episode of season 6. In this episode
the lives of several side characters from previous season is shown in modern
day for the show. Each one explains how their lives have changed because of
their interactions with the main character of the show and the main character
only made amends to people that stayed in his life and not to these side
characters impacted by his actions. They’re lives were affected by his actions
and the damage done to them bleeds over into their current life paths. One on
these side characters is an actress who was traumatized when BoJack Horseman
almost strangled her to death on set because he was on a drug fueled rage and
forgot that he was in character. The result of this was the actress being
cautious with every interaction she has on set and panicking every time
something slightly off script happens. Eventually she stops being recommend for
jobs and gets labelled as difficult to work with because of the trauma caused
by BoJack. BoJack is unaware of this impact because he was so far gone on
opioids that his memory of the situation may as well have been removed
(Netflix, 2019). This single action of BoJack has caused another person so much
damage that they’re labelled a problem in society causing greater implications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As a people, we have
a reason for remembering the good and bad parts of our lives. When we make
mistakes, they have consequences. Our memories and feelings of guilt afterwards
are just some things we have to deal with. As individuals we owe to our society
to remember our feelings of guilt because they’re experiences, we can grow from
and stories to share. The mark of learning from your guilt is the ability to acknowledge
you were wrong and to attempt to make amends. If we don’t do this, then we will
be bound to making the same mistakes again. The Japanese anime Naruto called
this cycle of repeating the same mistakes until they’re learned Izanami. In the
anime, the victim of the technique is placed into an illusion and will
continuously repeat the same series of events with the perpetrator. While going
through the illusion, the perpetrator repeatedly tells the victim to think
about their actions and focus on their mistakes. The cycle doesn’t break until
the lesson is learned by the victim about what they did wrong in the situation
(narutopedia, 2019). This cycle in this show can describe the ones that
individuals will experience in society if they erase their memories and don’t
remember the mistakes that they make. Mistakes have an impact on multiple
people in our society even if we want to believe they’re solely isolated
events. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The nature of
being a human being is that we’re social animals so when we do anything it has
an impact on the people around us. When what some people may brush off as a
mistake is made the implications of them feed into other parts of our world. <a>What
appears to be a simple mistake can expand into another person’s life and cause
their life to flip upside down. </a><span class=MsoCommentReference><span

name="_msoanchor_4">[AG4]</a>&nbsp;</span></span>An example of this can be Bobby
stepping on Alex’s shoes accidentally while at school. After this Bobby steps
on Alex’s all white air force one Nike’s, Alex gets upset and brutally beats
bobby up for doing that sending him to the hospital. The principal gets
involved and suspends Alex for doing that when Alex goes home his abusive
parents beat him twice, once for being sent home from school and another time
for destroying the new shoes that they bought him. Bobby is in the hospital
wondering why he was beaten so badly for a simple mistake. The reason that this
happened to Bobby is because Alex comes from an abusive household where his
parents neglect him and beat him. Being a young man who was only shown violence
and neglect, when his parents finally gifted him with these new sneakers Alex
cherished them. However, they also came with the mix emotions that his parents
threatened him that if he messed them up, they would beat him badly again. When
Alex was at school and Bobby stepped on his sneakers this cause Alex to panic
and react to the fear of being beaten by his parents, however since Alex lacked
coping mechanisms, he turned to what he was taught by his parent’s, violence.
The side effect of him turning to violence is that Alex’s parents had to
receive calls from the school and now are mandated to go there and talk about
their kid. Also, Alex’s abuse from his parents will now worsen because they’re
agitated by his actions and a student in the crowd that say what happened to
Bobby now has vicarious trauma from witnessing the brutal attack. As human
beings we connect with several different people through our single
interactions. This network that we spark though single interactions play a part
in our society. Even isolated events as the one described here can splinter off
in many different directions. That one student with vicarious trauma can get
treatment and afterwards be inspired to work in mental health where they help
hundreds of people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>For the next
example we will focus on how people surrounded by the individual getting their
memory erased are affected. Consider the scenario of Skylar, a young woman who
gave birth to a child at the age of 14. Skylar was raised by her single mother
who tries her best to be strict with her, but the mom has to work late every
night to keep the lights on in the house and by the time she gets home she
lacks the energy to discipline Skylar. Like many other teenagers Skylar, was defiant,
naïve to the world, and believed the bad stuff only happens on tv. Skylar cut
school one morning to go over to her friend’s house a college freshman who
recently graduated from her high school. and when she gets to her friend’s
house, she realizes that she was a lot more scared than she thought she would be,
but she thinks he’s cool so she goes along with the plan. When she gets to his
house she expects to just hang out and play games, when she gets there the
friend asks her if she would like to watch a movie. She obliges and agrees to
watch a movie with him. While watching the movie with him, she notices that her
starts putting his hands on her and feeling her up. She’s nervous and afraid
because he’s older than her and she’s somewhere she shouldn’t be. But she
doesn’t say anything in the hopes that he just stops. As the movie progresses
her friend progresses to the point where tries to make a move and kisses her.
She is caught off guard and frozen with fright because she doesn’t know what to
do. He starts to try and undress her, but she doesn’t budge and tells her
“come’ on stop being a tease”. Skylar mind is racing the whole time and she
thinks that she just wants this to stop but can’t vocalize it. The friend
begins to get aggressive with Skylar and moves past the point of just kissing
and a movie. Skylar finally says stop in a shaky voice towards him, but the
friend continues what he’s doing, and she starts to get louder constantly
saying “no, stop, no, stop, no, stop!”. Finally, the friend hears her and
stops, then he says, “If you didn’t want to do this then you would’ve never come
over here in the first place”. She keeps yelling but he just slaps her and
tells her “shut up, nobody is going to hear you here”. He proceeds to continue
being violent with her until she gets quiet and then he continues sexually
assaulting her. Skylar decides to just let it continue to happen and not speak
up because it was better than the pain he inflicted on her with each strike.
After he finishes, he tells her “see it wasn’t that bad, even you enjoyed it
after a while”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Skylar gathers her
things and goes home afterwards, not caring enough to fix her appearance. She’s
a shell of the person she once was, the naïveté was gone, and the defiance was
missing as well. Skylar goes to school and tries to escape the pain of what
happened to her by joining whatever will accept her. She finds a group of
friends at school who drink and smoke. Skylar sticks with them because smoking
calms her down and let’s her escape what she experienced. Also, unlike her mom
or teachers in school, they don’t tell her what to do;they just give her the
option and let her make the decision for herself. She starts failing her
classes and barely talks to people outside of those she deemed close enough to
talk to. <a>In April a letter is sent to her house saying that she’s at risk
for being left behind. Her mother being tired and no longer able to keep
talking to her explodes and beats Skylar one morning before school. Skylar
hasn’t been hit since that day she was assaulted at the beginning of the school
year. Skylar has been sick throwing up every morning since shortly after the
assault. After her mom beats her, she has flashbacks of the day the assault
occurred. She goes to the school and seeks out her friends to ask if they have
anything to calm her. They do and they offer her a barb (barbiturate). She
takes it and it does calm her down, but it makes her really sleepy as well. The
school notices her sleeping in class and hardly able to walk down the hallway.
They send her to the nurse’s office. There they realize she needs to go to the
hospital because she was in no condition to be in school. They call her mom and
let her mother know that an ambulance is taking her to the hospital. In the
hospital they run a urine test on Skylar to look for drugs and that’s when her
mom finds out that she’s positive for barbiturates and weed. Also, that she’s 7
months pregnant with a baby. At the hospital she’s screaming “why did he do
this to me? I don’t want to be alive!”. This is the day her mother finds out
what happened to Skylar and it breaks her heart to hear it. Skylar goes on to
have the kid. </a><span class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The child is the
result of a traumatic experience and when it was discovered she was pregnant;
it was discovered that she was assaulted as well. It was too far into the
pregnancy for her to get an abortion because it was the third trimester. After giving
birth, she gives the child up for adoption and then her mother takes her to a
clinic to have the memories of the past traumatic year erased. Skylar continues
her life as an adult, goes to school, graduates, gets married, and starts a
family. However, on her 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday a young woman shows up at her
doorstep who looks exactly like her. The woman claims to be this new mother’s
18-year-old daughter. Skylar doesn’t know who this young woman is and doesn’t
know what this she is talking about. But the young woman had the records from
the hospital of Skylar giving birth at the age of 14. Skylar avoids her and
think it’s a scam. In reality, the young woman is just trying to find her
mother because she’s been in and out of foster homes her whole life. The young
woman wants a DNA test with Skylar to prove whether or not she’s her mom. After
a couple of weeks of the young woman bothering Skylar, Skylar finally agrees to
go get a DNA test as long as her husband is with her. The DNA test results revealed
that yes indeed, Skylar is the mother of this 18-year-old. Now the effect of
these results ripple through a new family and Skylar now has a child that she
doesn’t know anything about; where this girl came from, how she ended up
pregnant. What happened that year when she was 14 is gone because of memory
erasure. Skylar’s husband is in shock and doesn’t know how to react to this
news. He tries asking her what happened, but Skylar can’t answer him because
the memories were erased. Now he thinks his wife is lying to him and hiding her
past from him. This puts pressure on their marriage and shatters what they
thought was a happy and perfect life. Their 2 young kids ages 5 and 7 are now wondering
why their parents are always fighting and where this new sister came from. The
father of the young woman is unknown because they were never caught, and Skylar
deleted the memory of the assault entirely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the other hand,
this young woman placed herself in a complicated predicament and was just
seeking her mother because she never had a stable life or environment. She
wanted to receive closure on a life in which she was never good enough for
anyone and she wanted to know why her biological parents gave her up. Now she
won’t receive that closure and doesn’t know how to move forward. She found her
mother but it’s a dead-end with nowhere else to go. She also sees that her
biological mother’s life is starting to fall apart because of this bombshell
news. Her self-esteem is cratering because the hope for closure is gone due to
the disappearance of her mom’s memories and she once again sees a place where
she isn’t wanted. She once again sees how her presence has caused more problems
than solutions on her end. Alas, the damage is done, and counseling or another
memory modification will be recommended to remedy what happened here. Not only
was Skylar’s life deeply affected, but her husband and three children as well.
Individuals who choose memory erasure may want to get rid of their pain, but
not realize that they can hurt the people around them in the process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The final example
is the individual’s direct experience with memory modification. Does erasing
the memory completely erase everything for the individual, Do the feelings of
being haunted by the trauma go away completely? Does the muscle memory and the
physical sensations of experiencing trauma diminish? The human body is very
unique in the way that it stores certain memories or skill sets. In the case of
Clive Wearing, he was left with a memory span of only seconds after being
struck by a brain infection. Although he was still able to play the piano, he
would never remember the song, how he learned to play it, or how to read the
sheet music. Regardless, he was able to play the piano via muscle memory and
this speaks to the body’s way of remembering experiences (Sacks, 2017). This demonstrates
the body’s ability to be resilient and cling on to the past even though the
mind has forgotten. In the case of erasing traumatic memories from the mind, do
we rob our bodies of the ability to heal and process experiences by taking the
route of erasing the memory? <a>In the case of memory modification, will there
be a case for a group of people who have random bodily sensations linked to
their traumas and no way to explain it. For this we can look at the example of
a war veteran who comes back after serving in the military. He goes through the
memory modification process and has his time at war erased. However, when he
was at a BBQ for fourth of July at the sound of fireworks, he dove on the
ground got into defensive position. This is a sign of his body still holding on
to Post traumatic stress disorder after the war and his memory was erased. If
this is the case for a single individual who comes back from war and has their
memory erased is this really a treatment for people suffering from PTSD or is
it just a band aid over a leaking wound. By saying that I mean are we just
covering up the damage done to people and not allowing the space for them to
genuinely heal and accept what happened to them. The human body has shown to be
incredibly resilient when remembering intense feelings and sensations, trauma
is an example of that. In the case of veterans, it states “some veterans
diagnosed with combat-related PTSD could find themselves on the ground, in a
defensive position, or ducking for cover after hearing fireworks going off or
from smelling the smoke in the air from the fireworks.”(Borukhovich, 2018). &nbsp;</a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><a>If we were to
treat them by erasing the memory or even erasing the emotions associated with
the memory of war, and they still maintain the physical reaction of ducking for
cover when they hear fireworks then the procedure may not have healed them or
left them in a better position than the one they started at. </a><span

of people who have specific physical reactions to triggers and it wasn’t noted
or tracked before the memory erasing procedure how will they begin treatment
for experiencing it. If one of those triggers is a combat reaction and the
veteran gets triggered, then the danger this treatment was supposed to stop won’t
stop. War is an event that isn’t normal at all. People who go to war and kill
people don’t come back unscathed, some type of damage is done to them in some
shape or form. It isn’t easy to recover from non-normative life events such as
war and there isn’t a way to cure someone of the trauma, they either inflicted
or experience. But simply erasing it isn’t may not be the way to go about
treating it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>However, if memory
modification worked as planned and actually cured people of Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder as intended what regulations would need to be put in place to
combat all the problems I listed? If the United Nations passed a resolution
saying memory modification is only allowed to be used under extreme medical
purposes and can’t be used for the harm and or control of other human beings,
then the discovery of how to modify memory was shared across the world. This
would then allow for the globe to hold each other accountable for their actions
using this newfound medical advancement. Also, if the treatment for PTSD didn’t
fully remove memories and instead only removed the emotions associated with the
memories would this then help mitigate all of the possible symptoms of PTSD
including the physical associations that come with it. If so then it may quite
possibly be acceptable that memory modification is the route to go when
treating trauma and more research should be done on it. However, if the UN
passed a resolution, not all nations will follow it and stick to it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In conclusion, I can’t
support memory modification because of the abuses and possible consequences
that can result from it. These abuses can occur at 3 different levels,
governmental, commercial, and personal. At the governmental level it can be
used to hide the atrocities that are committed to specific groups of people in
order for the government to maintain its control over the population. On the
commercial level it can create a society of people who avoid the realities of
their lives and doom themselves to repeat the same mistakes they’ve made in the
past because they erased the event they could’ve learned from. On the personal
level it can cause a family to fall apart when the past comes back to haunt the
individual in different ways with zero explanations as to why. Additionally,
the body has shown remarkable ways of holding on to memories in terms of
sensations and reactions. <a>If the memory is erased from the mind and not the
body, then you are denying yourself from healing. Lastly, even in a perfect
reality where this technology is fully fleshed and became an actual medical
tool. Still human beings who want to use this for wrong will take it and use
for wrong. I strongly believe memory modification is just a band-aid or a quick
fix to an issue that requires a lot of time and healing.</a><span

unaware of exactly how people are impacted by memory erasure in its entirety.
It can possibly have grave consequences beyond the ones I outlined here and
moving forward, we should proceed with caution in order to weigh the advantages
and disadvantages. Until we can begin to address even issues I outlined in this
paper, I will continue to not support memory erasure.</p>
